# Streamlytics - Movie Streaming Analytics (MySql)
An analytical SQL-based project designed to explore user behavior, content performance, and subscription-driven revenue insights for a movie streaming platform, similar to real-world OTT services like Netflix or Prime Video.

## Pupose:
Streamlytics is a MySQL analytics project that transforms raw streaming platform data into actionable insights.
The project focuses on understanding what users watch, how they engage with content, and how subscriptions contribute to revenue, enabling data-driven decisions in content strategy, marketing, and pricing.

## Tech Stack:
- 🛢 MySQL – Core database used for storing and querying structured streaming data
- 🧠 SQL Queries – Joins, subqueries, aggregations, window functions, CASE expressions
- 🔗 Relational Data Modeling – Relationships between users, movies, watch history, ratings, and subscriptions

## Business Problem:
Streaming platforms generate massive amounts of data, but without structured analysis it becomes difficult to answer key questions such as:
- Which movies and genres are most watched?
- What content receives the highest ratings?
- Which users are most engaged?
- Which subscription plans generate the most revenue?
- Raw data alone does not provide these insights efficiently.

## Objective:
To build a SQL-driven analytics solution that:
- Analyzes content performance and popularity
- Tracks user engagement and viewing behavior
- Evaluates subscription plans and revenue contribution
- Simulates real-world business analytics for OTT platforms

## Key Analysis:
📌 Content Insights
- Total movies available on the platform
- Movies released each year and genre-wise distribution
- Top-rated movies by year and genre
- Most-watched movies based on total watch time
- Least-watched content for performance optimization

📌 User Insights
- Users watching movies across multiple genres
- Comparison of user watch time against platform average
- Identification of highly engaged users (“power users”)
- Analysis of watched vs watched-and-rated behavior

📌 Subscription & Revenue Insights
- Active users per subscription plan
- Most-used subscription plans
- Total revenue generated from subscriptions
- Year-wise revenue trends
- Revenue contribution (%) of each subscription plan
